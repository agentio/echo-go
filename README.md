# Echo

This repo contains a simple echo service implemented with [grpc-go](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go), the official Go [gRPC](https://grpc.io) library, and [connect-go](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-go), the Go implementation of the [Connect RPC protocol](https://connectrpc.com/).

A server and clients for all methods are implemented with both "stacks" and can be used for side-by-side comparisons and examples of how to use both libraries.

Protocol buffer descriptions are in the [protos](/protos) directory.
